    "Page.About": `<h1> Q. What is WhoTalk? </h1> <p> WhoTalk is a Chat-based SNS platform that allows other people to talk to you anonymously. In the other way around, you can talk to others anonymously. </p><h1> Q. How does it work? </h1> <p> As you get signed in, you will get your own channel. Share your channel URL to your friends (by using facebook, twitter, etc.). </p><h1> Q. Is there an mobile app for this? </h1> <p> We are currently working on it. We will let you know as soon as it is done. </p><h1> Q. How is anonymous username generated? </h1> <p> You will get a unique anonymous username per channel. We store your information in session. So, the anonymous username will remain the same even if you revisit the channel. </p><h1>WhoTalk is an opensource project</h1> <p> The source code of this project can be retrieved from <a href="https://github.com/velopert/whotalk.us/">GitHub repository</a>.
